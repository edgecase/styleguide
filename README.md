New Context CSS and HTML style guide




Topics to discuss
==========

* ## Media Queries
	* Retina
	* Responsive (phone, tablet, desktop)
	* **Jerry:** I've found waiting to the end to do these is wayyy more difficult and soul crushing.


* ## Class naming
	* Avoid IDs
	* Avoid element type in CSS? Ex: p.error, li.item
	* Aim for shallow nesting of selectors
	
* ## Standardize on box model?
	* box-sizing: border-box;


* ## Standard control types?
	*  Buttons, popovers, forms, etc.
	
* ## How do we solve the stale CSS problem?
Too much crap gets left behind. Overrides from standard styles get messy and there is no standard place to put them.

* ## Avoid writing unnecessary markup
	* More to maintain
  * harder to manipulate
  * Could be the source of some unused styles
